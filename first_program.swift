// First program in Swift

print ("Hello, World!")
// Prints: Hello, world!

print ("I am an iOS Dev")
// Prints: I am an iOS Dev

// Note:

// Do not need to import a separate library for functionality like input/output or string handling.
// Code written at global scope is used as the entry point for the program, so you don’t need a main() function.
// Also don’t need to write semicolons at the end of every statement.







// Command to run the program: swift file_name.swift
