// Swift Structs

/*
In Swift, a struct is used to store variables of different data types.

For example:

Suppose we want to store the name and age of a person.
We can create two variables: name and age and store value.

However, suppose we want to store the same information of multiple people.

In this case, creating variables for an individual person might 
be a tedious task.
To overcome this we can create a struct that stores name and age.
Now, this struct can be used for every person.
*/

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Define Swift Structure

// Here's the syntax to define struct in Swift:

/*
struct StructureName {
  // structure definition 
}
*/

/*
Here:

struct - keyword used to define a structure
StructName - the name of the structure
*/

// Let's see an example,

/*
struct Person {

  // Note: The variables and constants inside a struct are called properties.

  var name = ""
  var age = 0
}
*/

/*
Here, we have defined a struct named Person. 
Inside the curly braces {}, the struct contains 
two variables name and age with 
values "" and 0 respectively.
*/

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Struct Instances

/*
A struct definition is just a blueprint. To use a struct, 
we need to create an instance of it. For example:
*/

/*
struct Person {

  var name = " "
  var age = 0
}

// create instance of struct
var person1 = Person()
*/

/*
Here, we have created an instance by writing the name 
of the structure Person followed by a default initializer ()

Now, we can use the person1 instance to access and modify 
the struct properties. For example:

modify the name property

person1.name = "Swift"

access the age property

person1.age

Here, we have used the dot notation . to access struct properties.
*/

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Example: Swift Access Struct Properties

/*
// define a structure 
struct Person {

// define two properties
 var name = ""
 var age = 0
}

// create instance of Person
var person1 = Person()

// access properties and assign new values
person1.age = 21
person1.name = "Rick"

print("Name: \(person1.name) and Age: \( person1.age) ")
*/

//Output

// Name: Rick and Age: 21

/*
In the above example, we have defined the struct named Person 
with two properties: name and age.

We have also created an instance person1 of the struct Person.

Finally, we have accessed and modified the properties of an 
instance using . notation.
*/

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Example: Create Multiple Instances of Struct

/*
// define a structure
struct Student {

// define a property
var studentID = 0
}

// instance of Person
var student1 = Student()

// access properties and assign new values
student1.studentID = 101

print("Student ID: \(student1.studentID)")

// another instance of Person
var student2 = Student()

// access properties and assign new values
student2.studentID = 102

print("Student ID: \(student2.studentID)")
*/

// Output
//Student ID: 101
//Student ID: 102

/*
In the above example, we have created two instances 
student1 and student2 of the Student struct

Note: We can create as many instances of the structure as we want.
*/

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Swift Memberwise Initializer

// Earlier we assigned a default value to a struct property.

/*
struct Person {
  
  var name = ""
}
*/

// We have created an instance using the default initializer.

//var person1 = Person()

// However, if we do not assign a default value to struct property.

/*
struct Person {
  
  var name: String
}
*/

// We pass value while creating an instance

//var person1 = Person(name: "Kyle")

/*
Here, values inside the parenthesis () are automatically assigned 
to corresponding properties of the struct. This is called a 
memberwise initializer.

Note: We can also use a memberwise initializer even if we have 
assigned a default value to a struct property.
*/

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Example: Memberwise Initializer

/*
struct Person {

// properties with no default values
var name: String
var age: Int
}

// instance of Person with memberwise initializer  
var person1 = Person(name: "Kyle", age: 19)

print("Name: \(person1.name) and Age: \( person1.age)")
*/

//Output
//Name: Kyle and Age: 19

/*
In the above example, we have created the instance person1 
for the Person struct.

Since we have not assigned default values to the properties, 
we use a memberwise initializer to assign values.
*/

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Function Inside Swift Struct

/*
We can also define a function inside a swift struct. 
A function defined inside a struct is called a method.
*/

/*
struct Car {

  var gear = 0

  // method inside struct
  func applyBrake(){
  print("Applying Hydraulic Brakes")
  }
}

// create an instance 
var car1 = Car()

car1.gear = 5

print("Gear Number: \(car1.gear)")
// access method
car1.applyBrake()
*/

//Output:
//Gear Number: 5
//Applying Hydraulic Brakes

/*
In the above example, we have defined the method named 
applyBraking() inside the Car struct. Notice the 
accessing of the method.

car1.applyBrake()

Here, we have used . notation to access method defined 
inside the struct. Finally, the statement inside the 
method is executed.
*/

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

/*
-Structures support many of the same behaviors as classes, 
including methods and initializers.

-One of the most important differences between structures and 
classes is that structures are always copied when theyâ€™re passed 
around in your code, but classes are passed by reference.

/*
-One of the most important differences between structures and 
classes is that structures are always copied (structure is a blue print
and to use it we create an instance of it. When we assign a variable "x"
of an instance to another variable "y", the values of an instance "x" is 
copied to another variable "y". It means if later you change the value
of an instance "x", then it would not change the value of instance "y"
since the value was copied and the instance "y" would retain the old
value which was assigned to it through "x" variable of an instance.)

Structures are always copied when theyâ€™re passed around in your code
(Here Structures passed around in your code means when you pass
the instance of a structure from "x" variable of an instance to "y" variable, 
values of an instance are copied.), but classes are passed by reference here
means when you pass the variable "x" of an instance of a class to the 
variable "y" of the same class. The values are not copied separately.
However, the both the "x" and "y" variable points or refer to the same
instance with the same values.

Examples:

// Value type example
struct S { var data: Int = -1 }
var a = S()
var b = a						// a is copied to b
a.data = 42						// Changes a, not b
println("\(a.data), \(b.data)")	// prints "42, -1"

--------------------------------------------------------

// Reference type example
class C { var data: Int = -1 }
var x = C()
var y = x						// x is copied to y
x.data = 42						// changes the instance referred to by x (and y)
println("\(x.data), \(y.data)")	// prints "42, 42"
